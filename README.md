# Choreo Quickstart

[Choreo](https://choreo.autos/) is a path generator commonly used in FRC for maximum speed in developing autonomous modes, it prioritizes time-optimized
trajectories for different drivetrain types.

We worked to adapt this system to FTC, allowing for Differential, Mecanum, and Swerve out of the box.

## Why Choreo over Pedro Pathing/RoadRunner/etc?

- It's super easy to use, you don't even need to restart your robot to get an updated autonomous.
- It's **accurate**, each trajectory takes full advantage of the drivetrain's performance while obeying it's dynamics constraints.
- You can still continue to use your autonomous modes after the new Control System releases in 2027.
- **It takes under 10 minutes to tune**, all you need to do is have your robot sit on the field, change some coefficients, and you're good to go.
